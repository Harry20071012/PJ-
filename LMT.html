    <p> La Min Thant, one of my friends. </p>

    <p> He was my first friends when I was in school. I have been friends with him for the last nine years. All of my friends, he is the one who knows about me the most. We have been good friends since we first met. I am months  older than him. People thought he is older than me because of his height. He is tallest of my friends. Even thought he is getting older but he still behaves like a chid. He is big baby. He doen't want to struggle to find a soloution. He doesn't like difficult situations.He doesn't like to deal with frusting things. But he always help friends when friends in trouble. This is his habit. He like to travel and most travel to the beach. He and I both love to travel to the beach. His hobbies are riding a bicycle, playing game and cooking curry. He like many thigs. His dream is a cheaf and he would like to compete in the US Master Cheaf Competiitons. I believe his hope will come true and going to help him.</p>
